## Introduction
This repository is intended to collect all the published works to which I personally contributed.

## Overview
- Rettore F., Russo M., Zerman L. & Castelletti F. (2022). *Clustering multivariate categorical data: a graphical model-based approach*.

Clustering multivariate data using mixture models is a well-studied topic in statistics.
In this contribution we propose a Bayesian framework for clustering categorical data which makes use of graphical models to account for possible group-specific dependence relations between variables. 
Our mixture model formulation allows to simultaneously infer a clustering structure of the units and the network of dependencies between variables.
